# Covid data analysis using SQL, Tableau and Excel.

I demonstrated my proficiency in using SQL to analyze data sets and extract insights. In the first project, I explored the number of people who have Covid in various countries, and in the second project, I delved into the number of people who have succumbed to the virus. By executing a query, I identified the highest infection rate in each country relative to its population.

During the course of the video, I shared a step-by-step process for calculating the percentage of vaccinated people in a specific country using a rolling people vaccine. I emphasized the importance of creating a column in a prior query and illustrated why a particular calculation would not yield accurate results.

To store data for future use, I walked viewers through the process of creating a view. Additionally, I demonstrated how to leverage Tableau Public to connect to the view and execute queries on the data.

Overall, I showcased my expertise in Excel, SQL and Tableau and provided valuable insights into how to leverage this powerful tool to gain valuable insights from complex data sets.
