# Tableau-Project---Covid-
Alex the analyst youtube

I demonstrated my proficiency in using SQL to analyze data sets and extract insights. In the first project, I explored the number of people who have Covid in various countries, and in the second project, I delved into the number of people who have succumbed to the virus. By executing a query, I identified the highest infection rate in each country relative to its population.
